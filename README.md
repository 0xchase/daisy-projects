# Daisy Ideas

Ideas for audio programming projects based on the daisy embedded platform.

### Generative Compiler Module
 - Create a scripting language for VSCODE, to generate songs for 8 different outputs
 - Compile script on computer, upload to module
 - Can feed inputs to high level generative features like dissonance, etc

### Eurorack Violin Module
 - Sample violinist (ask reddit, GSO, TRL)
 - Laser cut module front panel
 - Develop using samples of myself
 - For long notes, none, medium, and high vibrato amounts
 - Short notes also
 - Does the daisy have enough memory??? Probably not.
 - Alternative articulation options
 - Wood laser cut or hand carve front panel (could find UMD student to carve them). Stain wood like violin.
 - Include impulse response of violin body input/output
 - Seperate input for sample pitch and pitch bend pitch
 - Seperate inputs for various sample triggers
 - KickStarter to find the project
 - Contact strings to play, also can vibrato

Novelty eurorack modules (violin, etc)
Unique organic or acoustic modules
Piano module
Many piano samples
Modulated ones
AI piano model
Olafur piano mode
Strings module
Guitar module
AI model for eurorack note generation
Sample library company specifically for modular
How to do license protection, etc
Weird tone modulator modules
Pass through plate
Pass through paper
Pass through felt
etc
Other ideas
Integrate an AI model for playing that instrument???
Need semi-popular YouTube to advertise modules
Kickstarter video
Figure out how to make eurorack modules super cheap <$99 each???
Website has a line of introductory pieces
All-in-one muti-oscillator, filter
Super cheap filter
Super cheap oscillator


### Amp simulating eurorack module
 - Useful for sound processing

### Prepared piano module
 - Create various cool processed piano samples for it
 - Also normal piano samples

### Big Oscillator Module
 - Various options

### Muse Headset Module
 - CV output for each of the four brainwaves, knobs to steady signal
