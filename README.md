# Daisy Ideas

Ideas for audio programming projects based on the daisy embedded platform.

### Eurorack Violin Module
 - Sample violinist (ask reddit, GSO, TRL)
 - Laser cut module front panel
 - Develop using samples of myself
 - For long notes, none, medium, and high vibrato amounts
 - Short notes also
 - Does the daisy have enough memory??? Probably not.
 - Alternative articulation options
 - Wood laser cut or hand carve front panel (could find UMD student to carve them). Stain wood like violin.
 - Include impulse response of violin body input/output
 - Seperate input for sample pitch and pitch bend pitch
 - Seperate inputs for various sample triggers
 - KickStarter to find the project
 - Contact strings to play, also can vibrato

### Amp simulating eurorack module
 - Useful for sound processing

### Prepared piano module
 - Create various cool processed piano samples for it
 - Also normal piano samples

### Big Oscillator Module
 - Various options

### Muse Headset Module
 - CV output for each of the four brainwaves, knobs to steady signal
